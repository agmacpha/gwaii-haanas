## Recommendations

### Equipment servicing

- Equipment servicing is important to extend the life of the environmental sensor being used. Specifically, with ARUs, the calibration of microphones is important. Here are some recommendations:
  - Turgeon et al. 2017
  - Bioacoustic Unit Deployment Protocols
    - Provide recommendations for coastal forest

- Try monitoring NOFU on north point breeding potential
- Hide tide low tide effects
- LDFCs for abiotics
